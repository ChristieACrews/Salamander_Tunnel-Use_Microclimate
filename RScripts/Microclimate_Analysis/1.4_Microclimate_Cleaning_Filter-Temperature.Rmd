### Project

There but geriatric? A resurvey of salamander road mitigation infrastructure in Waterton Lakes National Park 15 years after installation reveals limited use by a small number of aged salamanders

<br> 
<br>

### Overview

<br>

#### **Goal(s):**

This script creates a data frame containing just soil temperature measurements.


<br>

#### **Details about files and pipeline:** 
<br>

1) File information 

The input file for this script is the output from the script "1.2 Microclimate Data Cleaning - Wide to Long". 

</blockquote> 

<br>

2) File contents 


<blockquote style="font-size: 100%;">


Columns in the input file: 

1)	Site: Unique site ID (categorical)

2)	SamplingDay: The number in sequence for the sampling event as sampling events cross midnight

3) Date: Date of measurement

4) RoadSide: Side of the road of the cover object (categorical)

5) CoverID: Unique ID for each cover object

6) SalamanderCapture: Whether a salamander was captured at the cover object 

7) Observers: Names of people who conducted the survey (text)

8) Notes: Any additional notes (text)

9) Tunnel: The ID of the tunnel associated with the stretch of a fence a given cover object is along (categorical - from 1 to 4)

10)	Latitude_dd: Latitude of a given cover object in decimal degrees

11) Longitude_dd: Longitude of a given cover object in decimal degrees

12) MeasurementType: Refers to both the climatic variable being measured (soil moisture vs temperature) and the location of the measurement (under vs beside cover object)

13) Value: Value of the given measurement

### Setting up the R environment
<br>

#### Working directory: 

```{r, message =FALSE}

# setwd("/Users/fabfa/OneDrive/Documents/0 - Frogs/Natural History Note/NatHisNote_DataAnalysis/Microclimate")
```
  
<br>  

#### Libraries: 

```{r, message=FALSE}

# load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

```
  
<br>  



### Data and Analysis 

#### Load and explore the data

1. Load the data: 

```{r}
### load data 
data <- read.csv("data/Microclimate_long.csv")
```

2. Check number of rows and columns is as expected:

```{r}
dim(data)
```

3. Get information about each column: 

```{r}
str(data) 
```




#### Filter to Soil Moisture

In this step I want filter to just the soil moisture measurement types:

```{r}
data_temp <- data %>% 
  filter(MeasurementType == "SubstrateTemp_UnderCover_C" | MeasurementType == "SubstrateTemp_OutsideCover_C")
```

To check

```{r}
dim(data_temp)
head(data_temp)
```


#### Change Column Names

Now, I want to change the column names to be more meaningful."Value" will be changed to "Soil_Temperature_C":

```{r}
data_temp_rename <- data_temp %>%
  rename(Soil_Temperature_C = Value)
```


For "MeasurementType" I want a more meaningful name ("CoverStatus), but also more concise values. The first step is the create a new column and input values as a more concise version of the value for "MeasurementType"

```{r}
data_temp_rename <- data_temp_rename %>%
  mutate(CoverStatus = case_when(
    MeasurementType == "SubstrateTemp_UnderCover_C" ~ "UnderCover",
    MeasurementType == "SubstrateTemp_OutsideCover_C" ~ "OutsideCover"))
```

Then, I will remove the "MeasurementType" column:


```{r}
data_temp_rename <- data_temp_rename %>% 
  select(-MeasurementType)
```


And to check everything went smoothly:

```{r}
#View(data_moisture_rename)
```



#### Final Output

Finally, we can save the new data frame

``` {r}
#create csv for the combined data
write.csv(data_temp_rename, "data/Microclimate_SoilTemperature.csv",
          row.names=FALSE)

```

### Conclusions 

Data cleaning is complete. The next step is data analysis.
